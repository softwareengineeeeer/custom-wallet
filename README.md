# Custom Wallet for Interexy - Task for checking technical skills 

## Project Description
The custom wallet for Interexy company for creating and accessing a simple Ethereum wallet. The application has two main parts: a setup phase for wallet creation and a main screen for wallet interaction. Developed as a part of checking technical skills using the following technologies:

`Tauri` - a base for creation of cross-platform applications using JS and Rust.

`Vite with React.js` - a frontend part of  application.

`Ethers.js v6` - library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem 

`MaterialUI & Emotion` - styling libraries used for creation of modern and acceptable UI.

`Redux-Toolkit` - state-management library

`Prettier, Eslint & plugins for them` - for following code style

## Instalation
This project uses `yarn` package manager.

To start the first step is dependencies installation:
###### Bash or Powershell
```
yarn
```

> NOTE: Keep in mind that the build of application will be created for the OS where you ran `yarn`, as it checks for shell you use. For example: `Ubuntu` users using Bash terminal will build application for LinuxOS, while `Windows` users using Powershell to run `yarn` command will build .exe application for Windows OS 

## Run In Development
#### The following commands will install necessary dependencies (depending on the OS & terminal you are using) and run the Application in Development mode.

> NOTE: Some crypto de/encryption functions are a little bit slow in development mode

###### Bash or Powershell
```
yarn

yarn tauri dev
```

## Production Building 

```yarn tauri build``` - builds an application. Build location is `src-tauri/target` folder by default.

> NOTE: Keep in mind that the build of application will be created for the OS where you ran `yarn`, as it checks for shell you use. For example: `Ubuntu` users using Bash terminal will build application for LinuxOS, while `Windows` users using Powershell to run `yarn` command will build .exe application for Windows OS

The way of running built for production application on different OS is different.
